The client, Kate, wants to open a similar bikeriding service like NYC's Citibike to Des Moines, Iowa. Part of the reason she believes in this idea is because of the positive impact Citibike had on her experiences taking a trip to NYC earlier. Kate has secured a meeting with some investors and wants to present an analysis of the NYC data to prove it's worth the risk. 

## Results

Below is a list of each of the visualizations on the NYC Citibike Story and what the results mean.

* Top Starting Locations
This geographical map shows the starting locations of every ride. It is clear that the most popular areas are in the center of the city and gradually spread out.
* Top Ending Locations
This geographical map shows the ending locations of every ride. Similar to the last graph, it is clear that the popular areas to return bikes are around the same areas that rides start.
* Checkout Times for Users (by hour)
This line graph shows the number of rides based on the duration of the trip. The current filter is set to only show hours from 0 up to 3. What's surpising is there were more checkout times over an hour than there were under.
* Checkout Times for Users (by Gender and Hour)
These groups of line graphs show the number of rides based on duration of the trip, this time with the added context of gender. It seems that the majority of rides are taken be men and that they generally take longer trips than other genders.
* Trips by Weekday per Hour
This heatmap shows the most popular hours of the day and days of the week that people take trips. From this graph, it seems that the most popular hours are from 8-9AM and from 5-7PM on Monday-Friday, with more general popular hours on the weekends.
* Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)
This heatmap shows the most popular hours of the day and days of the week that people take trips, with the added context of gender. Because we know that most trips are taken by men, it's unsurprising that that had the majority of color on the map.
* User Trips by Gender by Weekday
This heatmap shows the most popular trips taken by day and gender, with the extra context of what type of customer they are. It shows that most customers are subscribers (meaning repeat customer), and again the majority of those subscribers are men.
